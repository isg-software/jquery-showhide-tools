			<h2>Source files</h2>
			<div id="sec1">
				<p>This is not simply a demo page. This page uses the script file <code>accordeon-min.js</code>
				and the stylesheet <code>accordeon.css</code> that are distributed alongside the
				jquery plug-in (in the <code>dist</code> directory).</p>
				<p>You may use these files unaltered in your own projects, if the default configurations of
				those files fit your needs. Otherwise you may of course simply make copies of these files
				and alter your copies to your needs. In that case, you might want to copy the originals
				from the <code>src</code> directory, especially the minifies js file is not meant
				to be edited :-)</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		
		<section id="sec2_h">
			<h2>HTML Structure, HTML sections vs. "showOrHideSection()"</h2>
			<div id="sec2">
				<p>If you have a look at the source HTML file, you'll notice some simple, plain HTML document structure:
					You've got a div of class 'accordeon' which contains sections. Each section consists of a section
					heading (in this case a <code>h2</code>, but the script's not limited to this heading level) and a 
					<code>div</code> containing the main content which may be visible or invisible, depending on
					the section's visiblity. Only if the javascript (<code>accordeon(-min).js</code>) is loaded
					and executed successfully, this modifies the parsed DOM structure and wraps the headings (<code>h2</code>)
					in buttons which then may toggle the section visibility, equipped with a folding-arrow-icon,
					in this case not really an arrow, but a plus- or cross-icon with rotation-transition.
				</p>
				<p><em>Please not the slight conflict in terminology of what is meant with “section” and “heading”:</em>
					The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags in the HTML refer to the whole semantic HTML
					sections consisting of heading and content. But the headings are always visible, only
					the <em>section content</em> (first <code>div</code> with <code>id</code> attribute inside the section)
					is the part that can be shown or hidden via the <code>showOrHideSection()</code> function.
					So the word “section” in <code>showOrHideSection</code> does, in this structure not actually
					refer to a whole accordeon section (<code>&lt;section&gt;</code>), but to the section content.
					That's reflected by the hard-wired IDs in the source code: The section content <code>div</code>s
					get IDs like <code>"sec1"</code>.<br> The section heading elements (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) also
					don't actually refer to what the <code>showOrHideSection()</code> function refers to with its
					<code>heading</code> option: That heading option is used to reference the DOM node which should
					reflect the state, but in this case, I've decided I want to add the <code>showing</code>
					or <code>hidden</code> class respectively not to the h2 but to the whole section. That's why
					in the HTML code, the IDs with the standard <code>_h</code> suffix are assigned to the <code>section</code>
					elements instead of the <code>h2</code> elements. The <code>accordeon.css</code> contains rules
					that rely on this structure.
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>
		
		<section id="sec3_h">
			<h2>Accessibility and printability</h2>
			<div id="sec3">
				<p>This realization retains printablility: The stylesheet ensures two main features:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The accordeon styles like border, the icon reflecting the showing/hidden state etc. are 
						screen-only-styles and not visible in a print-out. The print will only contains the 
						section headings and section content.</li>
					<li>Also the CSS uses a display rule with <code>!important</code> flag in order to
						enforce visibility of all section's content when printing.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These features are meant to increase accessibility:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The toggle controls are buttons. (The buttons get injected by javascript on page load
						in order to keep the source HTML clean.) Buttons are easily focusable and usable
						by keyboard users.</li>
					<li>The <code>showOrHideSection()</code>'s <code>toggle</code> option is used to
						reference the buttons in order to equip them with an <code>aria-expanded</code>
						attribute. This way, the state is not only visible for seeing users, but also
						users of screen readers get announced the visibility state (expanded or collapsed)
						of each section when they focus the button containing the heading.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</section>
		
		<section id="sec4_h">
			<h2>Support for opening more than one section at the time (multi-select mode)</h2>
			<div id="sec4">
				<p>By default, the accordeon only ever shows one or no section. If one section is expanded
				 	and you toggle another section's heading, the new section will unfold, but the currently
				 	expanded section will collapse at the same time.</p>
				<p>If this is unwanted, the page author can globally disable this auto-fold feature by adding
					the class <code>multi</code> to the accordeon div: <code>&lt;div class="accordeon multi"&gt;</code>.
					This is demonstrated in a <a href="accordeon-multi.html">separate demo page
					for permanent multi-select mode</a>.
					</p>
				<p>But if this auto-folding is active (default), the user can still unfold more than one
					section at the same time:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>On a normal computer with keyboard (and usually mouse), a user may simply 
						press and hold the control or meta key. (On a Mac he has to use the command key,
						on a windows machine the control key is the preferred key.) While this key is
						pressed, a multi-selection mode is active, which (in case of the included stylesheet)
						is shown by a changing color of the plus icon: it turns green. In this mode (with
						control or meta key pressed) any toggling a section heading (regardless of whether it's clicked
						by mouse or by keyboard, focusing a button using the tab key and pressing it by
						pressing the space bar) will open this section without closing any other one.</li>
					<li>For multi-touch devices such as smart phones and tablets, the multi-select mode
						can be used by tapping a section heading and holding it (i.e. not removing the finger).
						Then more sections can be opened using a second finger. The multi-select mode
						ends as soon as the first finger gets liftet from the screen.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Stores for form transmission</h2>
			<div id="sec5">
				<p>Just like in earlier demos, this demo includes the feature to reflect the state
					of each section in a form input element. Normally, these would be hidden inputs.
					Such inputs can be used to transmit the state (which section(s) is/are expanded)
					to a server whenever a form (containing the accordeon) is transmitted to a
					web application server, in order to enable the web app to return a page
					containing the very same accordeon in the same state.</p>
				<p>The use of a store is optional in the included <code>accordeon-min.js</code> script.
					To enable it, the <code>&lt;div class="accordeon"&gt;</code> tag is equipped
					with a data-attribute defining the store selector (see jsdoc of plug-in), 
					in this demo thats:<br> <code>&lt;div class="accordeon" data-store-selector="#${id}_store"&gt;</code>.</p>
				<p>Just for demonstration and testing purpose, this page uses visible (read-only)
					text inputs for these stores. You'll find them at the bottom of the page.
