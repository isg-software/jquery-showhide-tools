	<h1>Demos / Examples for jquery-showhide-tools</h1>
	<h2>Main Tool: showing or hiding sections</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="showhide.html">Basic showOrHideSection demos</a></li>
		<li><a href="showOrHideChildren.html">showOrHideChildren() demo</a></li>
		<li><a href="withFoldingArrows.html">Demo for showOrHideSection() combined with folding-arrow-icons plug-in</a></li>

	</ul>
	<h3>Example applications</h3>
	<p>The example pages above use page-specific JavaScript code. But if you're developing a more complex web application, you might
		want to write some cross-page JavaScript files and use them for many web pages. In these pages you then mainly setup
		the functionality by annotating your HTML with class attributes and load your central JavaScript and CSS files.<br>
		Some JavaScript and CSS files for some example applications of the plug-ins are included and get demonstrated by the
		following demo pages. You may use these script and CSS files directly if they suit your needs, or you may simply see them
		as examples or blue-prints for your own scripts and styles.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="enable-default-links.html">enable-default-links</a></li>
		<li><a href="accordion.html">accordion</a> (uses the included files <code>accordion(-min).js</code> and <code>accordion.css</code>)</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Additional tools for showing or hiding content:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="appendmore.html">Demo for appendMoreLinks</a></li>
		<li><a href="slidingpanels.html">Sliding Panels (Demo 1, static panels)</a></li>
		<li><a href="slidingpanels2.html">Sliding Panels (Demo 2, dynamic panels)</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Lower Level Tools: Viewport tests and alignments</h2>
	<p>These tools are used internally by the main show-hide plug-in functions, but since they are implemented as jQuery plug-in functions,
		they may also be used stand-alone:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="viewport-vertical.html">Demos with (vertically scrolling) window as viewport</a></li>
		<li><a href="viewport-horizontal.html">Demos with horizontally scrolling container (div) as viewport</a></li>
	</ul>
